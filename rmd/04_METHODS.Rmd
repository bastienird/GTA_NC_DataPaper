# Methods

_The Methods should include detailed text describing any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition and any computational processing. See [the detailed section in our submission guidelines](https://www.nature.com/sdata/publish/submission-guidelines#sec-5) for advice on writing a transparent and reproducible methods section. Related methods should be grouped under corresponding subheadings where possible, and methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the full study. Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data citation (see Data Records and Citing Data, below).
Authors should cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. There is no limit to the length of the Methods section._
