	abstract = {Methods that use only fisheries catch records to determine the status of exploited fish populations have been used to draw important conclusions regarding the world's fisheries. The reliability of two such approaches is evaluated by simulating a range of fisheries development and overfishing scenarios. The success rate and bias of stock status classification by two catch-based methods is compared with those of two stock assessment methods that explicitly model population dynamics and use additional fishing effort data. On average the catch-based methods correctly classified the status of stocks in 31\% and 34\% of the cases considered. Two simple stock assessments successfully classified stock status in 57\% and 59\% of the cases. The catch-based methods and the surplus production stock assessment were negatively biased and on average provided overly pessimistic conclusions regarding stock status. Catch-based methods were more negatively biased on average than the stock assessment approaches.},

	abstract = {The degree to which a stock is depleted is one of the most important quantities in fisheries management because it is used to quantify the success of management and to inform management responses. However, stock depletion is extremely difficult to estimate, particularly with limited data. Using the RAM Legacy database, we developed a boosted regression tree (BRT) model to correlate depletion with a range of predictors calculated from catch data, making the model usable for many fisheries worldwide. The most important predictors were found to be catch trends obtained from linear regressions of scaled catch on time, including regression coefficients for the whole catch time series, the subseries before and after the maximum catch, and in recent years. Eight predictors explain about 80\% of variation in depletion. There is a correlation of .5 between measured levels of depletion and the predictions of the BRT model. Predictions are less biased when the stock is fished down below half of the carrying capacity. The BRT model outperforms comparable existing catch-based depletion estimators and could be used to provide priors for depletion for data-poor stock assessment methods, or used more directly to provide estimates of the probability that depletion is below a given threshold value.},

	abstract = {This study provides a historical overview of the use of drifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs) in purse seine fisheries since the early 1990s, using global tuna fisheries datasets from the four tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Tropical tuna purse seine fisheries typically target large yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tunas on free-swimming schools and skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and juveniles of yellowfin and bigeye associated with drifting objects. DFADs have enabled global skipjack catches to markedly increase, and have also introduced major scientific issues for all tuna-RFMOs. In particular, they have strongly modified the fishing strategies of purse seiners that fish on a combination of free-swimming and DFAD-associated schools. Consequently, the cumulated search time traditionally used to quantify nominal fishing effort to assess the status of tuna stocks is inconsistent and cannot be used to derive time series of abundance indices from catch-per-unit of-effort (CPUE). In addition, the lack of information available on the construction, deployment, and use of DFADs has prevented effective monitoring of the fishing pressure over the last two decades exerted by purse seine fleets using this fishing mode. Juveniles of tropical tunas represent a substantial proportion of purse seine catch on DFADs in the three oceans, which has raised particular concern for some bigeye stocks that have been subject to overfishing in the past. Catches of juvenile tunas by DFAD fishing may also result in a decrease in recruitment for fisheries that target adult tunas such as longliners. In addition, some demographic parameters of tunas and other species associated with DFADs may be affected by the resultant habitat modification arising from the widespread deployment of DFADs. Evidence in the literature and provided by the ratio-estimator method suggest that fishing DFAD-associated schools may result in about 100 000 t of bycatch and discards annually. In addition, there is further potential for ghost fishing related mortality of sensitive species such as marine turtles and pelagic sharks. In this context and following a precautionary approach, we finally discuss the increasing need for all tuna-RFMOs to reduce, or at least monitor and control, the use of DFADs to mitigate their adverse effects not only on yellowfin and bigeye stocks but also on open-ocean ecosystems.},

One class of these methods requires only catch time series and, in some cases, information about life history or fishery characteristics, to estimate stock status. These catch-only methods (COMs) range from statistical models trained on data-rich stocks to mechanistic population models that make assumptions about changes in fishing effort. We review 11 COMs, comparing performance through application to data-rich stocks and simulated fisheries. The catch-only methods evaluated here produce imprecise and biased estimates of B/BMSY, especially for stocks that are lightly exploited. They were also generally poor classifiers of stock status. While no method performed best across all stocks, ensembles of multiple COMs generally performed better than individual COMs. We advocate for testing new COMs using this common platform. We also caution that performance in estimating stock status is not sufficient for gauging the usefulness of COMs in managing fisheries. Greater use of management strategy evaluation is needed before COMs can be considered a reliable tool for management.},

A subset of high-confidence filtered DT data was retained for 5807 fish at liberty for 30d or more, for evaluating linear displacements from release to recapture positions. For the filtered DT data, days at liberty ranged from 30 to 1701d (median=187 d). Linear displacements ranged from 1 to 5372 nautical miles (M) (median=936M), with 71\% eastward and 29\% westward, and 95\% within 3614M of their release positions. The data indicate significant differences in the linear displacements by release locations, days at liberty, and fish length at release. An unscented Kalman filter model with sea-surface temperature measurements integrated (UKFsst) was used to process 48 AT data sets from bigeye tuna at liberty for 30d or longer, to obtain most probable tracks, improved estimates of geographic positions, and movement parameters. The 95\% volume contours surrounding the position estimates, along the most probable tracks from bigeye tuna releases along the 140° W, 155° W, 170° W, and 180° meridians show substantial overlap. For the pooled AT data sets, the median parameter estimates from the UKFsst model for errors in longitude (σx) and latitude (σy) were 0.52° and 1.75°, for directed eastward and northward movements (u and v) were −2.01M/d and −1.41M/d, and for dispersive movement (D) was 496.7M2/d. The linear displacements and most probable tracks obtained from these tagging data demonstrate constrained latitudinal dispersion, some regional fidelity, some extensive eastward longitudinal dispersion, and substantial mixing of bigeye tuna between release longitudes. The amount of mixing of bigeye tuna among these release areas in the equatorial central Pacific Ocean, with those in adjacent areas of the equatorial eastern and western Pacific Ocean, is dependent on distances between areas, with, in general, the greatest mixing occurring between the areas that are closest to one another.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

In this paper, a general framework is presented for developing more appropriate abundance indices based on fishery catch and effort data. In developing this framework, it adopts the approach of (i) developing a range of hypotheses which encompass the uncertainties in the spatial–temporal dynamics of the stock and the fishing effort, (ii) identifying the hypotheses underlying the different CPUE series, and (iii) evaluating the available information relative to these hypotheses as the basis for evaluating CPUE indices. Observations from the fishery for southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) are used to illustrate various hypotheses about the nature of the fishery which can be used to construct indices of stock abundance while a simple simulation framework is used to explore the implications of some of these hypotheses on the accuracy of such indices.},

Tuna distributions are highly conditioned by sea temperature, for this reason and their worldwide distribution, their populations may be a good indicator of the effect of climate change on global fisheries. This study shows the shift of tuna catches in subtropical latitudes on a global scale. From 1965 to 2011, the percentage of tropical tuna in longliner catches exhibited a significantly increasing trend in a study area that included subtropical regions of the Atlantic and western Pacific Oceans and partially the Indian Ocean. This may indicate a movement of tropical tuna populations toward the poles in response to ocean warming. Such an increase in the proportion of tropical tuna in the catches does not seem to be due to a shift of the target species, since the trends in Atlantic and Indian Oceans of tropical tuna catches are decreasing. Our results indicate that as populations shift towards higher latitudes the catches of these tropical species did not increase. Thus, at least in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, tropical tuna catches have reduced in tropical areas.},

(sailfishes), Makaira (marlins), and Tetrapturus (spearfishes, white, and striped marlins). Phylogenetic analyses of molecular data from mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences (mitochondrial control region, ND2, 12S, and nuclear MN 32 regions) show a different picture of relationships.
Makaira is not monophyletic: blue marlin cluster with sailfish and placement of black marlin is un-stable. Accepting the molecular phylogeny gives two possible classifications: (1) two genera: blue marlin + sailfish (as Istiophorus) and all the rest (as Tetrapturus), or
(2) five genera: blue marlin (Makaira), sailfish (Istiophorus), black marlin (Istiompax), striped and white marlin (Kajikia), and four spearfishes (Tetrapturus). We prefer the latter possibility. There is no genetic evidence to support recognition of separate
species of Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sailfishes or blue marlins. Atlantic white marlin, Kajikia albida (Poey, 1860) is closely related to Indo-Pacific striped marlin, Kajikia audax (Philippi, 1887). The four spearfishes are closely related: the three Atlantic species, longbill
(Tetrapturus pfluegeri Robins and de Sylva, 1963), Mediterranean (Tetrapturus belone Rafinesque, 1810), and roundscale (Tetrapturus georgii Lowe, 1841), and the one Indo-Pacific species, shortbill (Tetrapturus angustirostris Tanaka, 1915). The roundscale is the
most divergent of the spearfishes. A fifth putative Tetrapturus sp., the "hatchet marlin" clusters with roundscale spearfish but these two "species" could not be differentiated in this analysis.},

This pattern can be formalized as the range–abundance relationship, a general macroecological pattern that has important implications for the conservation of threatened species. Here we ask whether similar responses may have occurred in highly mobile pelagic predators, specifically 13 species of tuna and billfish. We analyzed two multidecadal global data sets on the spatial distribution of catches and fishing effort targeting these species and compared these with available abundance time series from stock assessments. We calculated the effort needed to reliably detect the presence of a species and then computed observed range sizes in each decade from 1960 to 2000. Results suggest significant range contractions in 9 of the 13 species considered here (between 2\% and 46\% loss of observed range) and significant range expansions in two species (11–29\% increase). Species that have undergone the largest declines in abundance and are of particular conservation concern tended to show the largest range contractions. These include all three species of bluefin tuna and several marlin species. In contrast, skipjack tuna, which may have increased its abundance in the Pacific, has also expanded its range size. These results mirror patterns described for many land predators, despite considerable differences in habitat, mobility, and dispersal, and imply ecological extirpation of heavily exploited species across parts of their range.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive catch data are fundamental to support the sustainable management of large pelagic fisheries. However, catch data reported by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) on behalf of its member countries currently under-represent the extent of these fisheries in the Indian Ocean. We reconstructed fisheries catches of large pelagic species for the Indian Ocean from 1950 to 2020, aiming to improve the comprehensiveness of existing reported data and to provide more ecologically relevant datasets for research and management uses. We reconstructed catches for 42 countries operating five major gear groups (longline, purse seine, gillnet, pole-and-line, and other gears) in the large pelagic fisheries. Reconstructed catches were 30\% higher than the data reported by the IOTC. We demonstrated that distant-water fishing fleets historically dominated large-scale industrial fishing but were gradually replaced by fleets flagged to Indian Ocean rim countries. Our results also indicated an average discard rate of {\textasciitilde}14\% over the 1950-2020 period, primarily attributable to extensive discarding practices associated with longline and gillnet vessels. Reporting over time has improved only for tunas, whereas shark catches still remain under-reported, accounting for 51\% of total unreported landings and discards in 2020. We confirmed substantial taxonomic aggregation in the data reported by the IOTC on behalf of its member countries, masking important patterns and trends and further complicating the sustainable management of exploited species in the Indian Ocean. We recommend substantially increased observer coverage and far better and stronger support by all member countries to improve the fisheries statistics in the IOTC.},

	abstract = {Fishing takes place in the high seas and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of maritime countries. Closing the former to fishing has recently been proposed in the literature and is currently an issue of debate in various international fora. We determine the degree of overlap between fish caught in these two areas of the ocean, examine how global catch might change if catches of straddling species or taxon groups increase within EEZs as a result of protection of adjacent high seas; and identify countries that are likely to gain or lose in total catch quantity and value following high-seas closure. We find that {\textless}0.01\% of the quantity and value of commercial fish taxa are obtained from catch taken exclusively in the high seas, and if the catch of straddling taxa increases by 18\% on average following closure because of spillover, there would be no loss in global catch. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, would decrease from 0.66 to 0.33. Thus, closing the high seas could be catch-neutral while inequality in the distribution of fisheries benefits among the world's maritime countries could be reduced by 50\%.},

	abstract = {Context Contrary to other ocean basins, Indian Ocean catches have increased consistently since 1950, although reported data are known to be incomplete. Fish is a crucial food source in the Indian Ocean; however, ineffective management often empowers over-exploitation.Aims We synthesised and reviewed Indian Ocean reconstructed catch and effort data by fishing sector and fishing country at the ocean-basin scale.Methods We aggregated reported and reconstructed unreported catch and effort data for the Indian Ocean and derived catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) time-series by sector.Key results Indian Ocean rim country catches dominated in the Indian Ocean. Small-scale catches in the Indian Ocean have grown continuously by over 300\% from 1.9×106tonnes (Mg)year−1 in 1950 to 6.5×106tonnesyear−1 by 2018. By contrast, total industrial catches from the Indian Ocean have reached a plateau at {\textasciitilde}8.5×106 tonnesyear−1 since the late 1990s, after having steadily risen from very low levels in the early 1960s. Unreported catches declined from 45 to 25\% of total catches. Total fishing effort, driven by the industrial sector, has increased 30-fold since 1950 from 0.4×109 to 11×109 kW-days by 2010, whereas CPUE has declined 78\%, with steeper declines in the small-scale ({\textgreater}80\% since 1950) than in the industrial sector (65\% from its 1981 peak).Conclusions The different sectoral patterns in the Indian Ocean compared with other ocean basins are likely to be due to the region’s high dependence on small-scale fisheries and the later onset but swift growth of industrial fishing. The declining CPUE suggests strong decreases in stock biomass caused by strongly increasing fishing effort, especially in the industrial sector.Implications Indian Ocean countries should prioritise lower-impact well-managed domestic small-scale fisheries to maximise long-term, sustainable nutrient supply for local livelihoods.},

A total of 30 fisheries were finally determined from longline, purse seine and other-gears data sets, from which 10 longline and 4 purse seine fisheries represented 96 \% of the whole historical geo-referenced catch. Nevertheless, one-third of total nominal catch is still not included due to a total lack of geo-referenced information and would need to be processed separately, accordingly to the requirements of the study.

Many fisheries are not assessed by standard stock assessment methods including many in the world's most biodiverse areas. Though simpler methods using widely available catch data are available, these are often discounted largely because data on fishing effort that contributed to the changes in catches are mostly not considered. We analyse spatial and temporal patterns of global fishing effort and its relationship with catch to assess the status of the world's fisheries. The study reveals that fleets now fish all of the world's oceans and have increased in power by an average of 10-fold (25-fold for Asia) since the 1950s. Significantly, for the equivalent fishing power expended, landings from global fisheries are now half what they were a half-century ago, indicating profound changes to supporting marine environments. This study provides another dimension to understand the global status of fisheries.},

These data are longline catch per unit effort from 1958 to 2007 for albacore, Atlantic bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas. Both quotient analysis and Generalised Additive Models were used to determine habitat preference with respect to eight biotic and abiotic variables. Results confirmed that, compared to temperate tunas, tropical tunas prefer warm, anoxic, stratified waters. Atlantic and southern bluefin tuna prefer higher concentrations of chlorophyll than the rest. The two species also tolerate most extreme sea surface height anomalies and highest mixed layer depths. In general, Atlantic bluefin tuna tolerates the widest range of environmental conditions. An assessment of the most important variables determining fish habitat is also provided.},

Efforts to spatially quantify the historical catch of global tuna fisheries have been restricted to the few taxa of major economic interest, creating a truncated view of the true extent of the fisheries for tuna and other large pelagic fishes. Individual Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) have given varying degrees of attention to minor taxa and non-target species only in more recent years. Here, we compiled and harmonized public datasets of nominal landed catches, as well as spatial data on reported catches of large pelagic taxa reported for the industrial tuna and large pelagic fisheries by tuna RFMOs for the last 60+ years. Furthermore, we provide a preliminary estimate of marine finfishes discarded by these fisheries. We spatialized these data to create a publicly available, comprehensive dataset presenting the historical reported landed catches plus preliminary discards of these species in space for 1950–2016. Our findings suggest that current public reporting efforts are insufficient to fully and transparently document the global historical extent of fisheries for tuna and other large pelagic fishes. Further harmonization of our findings with data from small-scale tuna fisheries could contribute to a fuller picture of global tuna and large pelagic fisheries.},

The total world catch of these species has increased during the last 50 years (from 0.4 to 3.9 million MT), but the pattern of increase has varied among species, oceans and fishing gears. The causes of those variations are analyzed in this paper. In the world catch, the Pacific Ocean has been predominant throughout. In recent years catches from of the  Indian Ocean have exceeded those of the Atlantic. Skipjack and yellowfin catches have shown a rapid increase. Bigeye catches also showed a constant increase, but at a lower level. The catches of albacore, bluefin and southern bluefin tunas have been stable or have decreased in recent years. The baitboat fishery took the greatest proportion of the total catches during the 1950s. However, the catch of the purse-seine fishery, became significant in the late 1950s, and became dominant by 1990.  Lon gline catches started picking up in the late 1950s, increased until the 1990s and thereafter declined.},

These stocks vary in status from lightly exploited to rebuilding to severely depleted. Previous studies suggested that this variability could result from differences in life-history characteristics and economic incentives, but differences in exploitation histories and management measures also have a strong effect on current stock status. Although the status (biomass and fishing mortality rate) of major tuna and billfish stocks is well documented, the effect of these diverse factors on current stock status and the effect of management measures in rebuilding stocks have not been analysed at the global level. Here, we show that, particularly for tunas, stocks were more depleted if they had high commercial value, were long-lived species, had small pre-fishing biomass and were subject to intense fishing pressure for a long time. In addition, implementing and enforcing total allowable catches (TACs) had the strongest positive influence on rebuilding overfished tuna and billfish stocks. Other control rules such as minimum size regulations or seasonal closures were also important in reducing fishing pressure, but stocks under TAC implementations showed the fastest increase of biomass. Lessons learned from this study can be applied in managing large industrial fisheries around the world. In particular, tuna regional fisheries management organizations should consider the relative effectiveness of management measures observed in this study for rebuilding depleted large pelagic stocks.},

In a paper presented in 2016 at the IOTC WPDSC12 (WPDCS12-27), we had introduced the global harmonized database for tuna fisheries that we have developed by collating the public domain datasets (total catch, monthly-spatially aggregated catch and effort) from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), the Western-Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). We had as well introduced the set of open source codes (the "toolbox") to handle the data, i.e. transform the data formats, load the standardized data into the database, and compute a suite of indicators. However, the project - both the data and the toolbox - was still at an early stage of development. Details on the benefits of this global database for fisheries science and management, as well as technical details on the database, were also exposed in previous papers (ICCAT SCRS/2016/202). In this paper, we expose the progresses that we have made in 2017. We first present the diversity of data that are available in the open database, and we then focus on the tools that we have developed to access and exploit efficiently the data.},

	abstract = {In a recent commentary, Pauly and Zeller disagreed with the Food and Agriculture Organization's interpretation of its global capture fishery production records, arguing that trends were distorted by unreliable statistics in some countries. They criticized FAO for not having used their “catch reconstructions” in the 2016 State of the World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA) report and questioned the interpretation and significance of FAO's aquaculture production statistics. In this paper, we refute their claims and demonstrate that their critique is based on fundamental misunderstandings caused by mixing up statistical metrics and using simple normative explanations to interpret highly complex datasets. We explain how FAO maintains, curates and updates the only validated source of global fisheries landings, describe our capacity building projects and activities underpinning the annual updates for the over 231 different sources of fisheries data, and clarify such updates include dialogues with member countries to improve and revise present and historical records. FAO will continue to work closely with member states, IGOs, NGOs, academia and civil society, to further improve fishery and aquaculture databases, while calling on states to make renewed efforts to improve data quality. It also welcomes research efforts that contribute to the improvement of statistical data which are critical to the sustainable management of fisheries and aquaculture.},

Here, using a decade-long multinational ‘catch reconstruction’ project covering the Exclusive Economic Zones of the world’s maritime countries and the High Seas from 1950 to 2010, and accounting for all fisheries, we identify catch trajectories differing considerably from the national data submitted to the FAO. We suggest that catch actually peaked at 130 million tonnes, and has been declining much more strongly since. This decline in reconstructed catches reflects declines in industrial catches and to a smaller extent declining discards, despite industrial fishing having expanded from industrialized countries to the waters of developing countries. The differing trajectories documented here suggest a need for improved monitoring of all fisheries, including often neglected small-scale fisheries, and illegal and other problematic fisheries, as well as discarded bycatch.},

As such, we estimated global fishing capacity and effort from 1950 to 2012 using a relatively comprehensive database developed by the FAO, supplemented by other data sources. Using random sampling techniques, we estimated the uncertainty surrounding many of our estimates enabling the identification of deficiencies and limitations. Global fishing capacity and effort increased rapidly from the late 1970s through to around 2010 before stabilizing. The Asian fleet is more than an order of magnitude larger than any other region in both capacity and effort, and continues to increase. Most other regions have stabilized, and there have been considerable declines in Europe and, to a lesser extent, in North America. Developed nations, as a whole, have decreased in both measures in the recent years and are responsible for the stabilization of the global trend. Developing and undeveloped countries are still increasing with the former having the largest fleet and showing the greatest relative increase with the socioeconomic impacts of reversing these trends likely to be high. The efficiency of the global fleet, in terms of watt days of fishing effort per tonnage of wild marine catch, is now less than in 1950 despite the considerable technological advances, and expansion throughout the world's oceans, that has occurred during this period of time.},

Data deficiencies, however, currently hamper analysis of global fishing effort. We analyzed data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the EUROPA fishing fleet registry, and peer-reviewed and other publications, to determine the global trends in fishing effort from 1950 to 2006. Our results show that global fishing effort, expressed as total engine power and the number of fishing days in a year (kilowattdays), was roughly constant from 1950 to 1970, and then steadily increased up to the present. Europe dominated global fishing effort, followed by Asia. Projecting current trends suggests that Asia will soon surpass Europe. Trawlers contribute a major fraction of global fishing effort, as do vessels greater than 100 gross registered tons. Current estimates of global fishing effort, the number of vessels, and total vessel tonnage are, however, underestimates given the data gaps that we have identified. Our results are useful in the following ways: (1) they may encourage researchers in academia and government to improve global fishing effort databases; (2) they allow deeper global analyses of the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems; (3) they induce caution in accepting current underestimates of economic losses of global fisheries; and (4) they reinforce calls for a reduction in global fishing effort.},

Tuna represent a significant part of the global seafood market with an annual value exceeding USD\$42B and are vulnerable to overfishing. Our understanding of how social and economic drivers contribute to overexploitation is not well developed. We address this problem by integrating social, ecological and economic indicators to help predict changes in exploitation status, namely fishing mortality relative to the level that would support the maximum sustainable yield (F/FMSY). To do this we examined F/FMSY for 23 stocks exploited by more than 80 states across the world’s oceans. Low-HDI countries were most at risk of overexploitation of the tuna stocks we examined and increases in economic and social development were not always associated with improved stock status. In the short-term frozen price was a dominant predictor of F/FMSY providing a positive link between the market dynamics and the quantity of fish landed. Given the dependence on seafood in low-income regions, improved measures to safeguard against fisheries overexploitation in the face of global change and uncertainty are needed.},

	abstract = {Previous reconstructions of marine fishing fleets have aggregated data without regard to the artisanal and industrial sectors. Engine power has often been estimated from subsets of the developed world, leading to inflated results. We disaggregated data into three sectors, artisanal (unpowered/powered) and industrial, and reconstructed the evolution of the fleet and its fishing effort. We found that the global fishing fleet doubled between 1950 and 2015—from 1.7 to 3.7 million vessels. This has been driven by substantial expansion of the motorized fleet, particularly, of the powered-artisanal fleet. By 2015, 68\% of the global fishing fleet was motorized. Although the global fleet is dominated by small powered vessels under 50 kW, they contribute only 27\% of the global engine power, which has increased from 25 to 145 GW (combined powered-artisanal and industrial fleets). Alongside an expansion of the fleets, the effective catch per unit of effort (CPUE) has consistently decreased since 1950, showing the increasing pressure of fisheries on ocean resources. The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries, challenging sustainable use of fisheries' resources.},

	abstract = {Many of the world’s fish stocks are depleted as a result of overexploitation, pollution and habitat loss. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) sets a target for fisheries to maintain or restore stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015. We assessed the global stock status and found that 68\% were at or above the MSY level in 2008 and that the 2015 target is unlikely to be met. We compiled data for eight indicators to evaluate the sustainability of fisheries and the gap to meet the WSSD target. These indicators show that the overall condition of global fisheries is declining, long-term benefits are being compromised, and pressures on fisheries are increasing despite fisheries policy and management actions being taken by coastal States. We develop a bio-economic model to estimate the costs and benefits of restoring overfished stocks. Our results show that the global fishing capacity needs to be cut by 36–43\% from the 2008 level, resulting in the loss of employment of 12–15 million fishers and costing US{\textbackslash}96–358 billion for buybacks. On the other hand, meeting the WSSD goal will increase annual fishery production by 16.5 million tonnes, annual rent by US{\textbackslash}32 billion and improve biodiversity and functioning of marine ecosystems. However, progress towards rebuilding has been hindered by an unwillingness or inability to accept the short-term socio-economic consequences associated with rebuilding fisheries. Thus, there is a pressing need for integration of rebuilding plans into national political and economic decision-making.},
